LJMU MSc final project

## Project title:
### Analysis of Tabular Data Using Local Deployment vs. Cloud Services, with Data Pipelines Optimisation for Cloud Deployment.
 

# Project background: 
Gathering, evaluating, and drawing conclusions from massive amounts of

numerical data is a problem that organisations in a variety of sectors face. The sheer size and

complexity of large datasets frequently cause performance and scalability problems for

local computing infrastructures. As a result, combining cloud computing technology with data

science methodology has become a viable strategy for overcoming these obstacles.

 

## Aim: 
This project aims to investigate the feasibility as well as effectiveness of using data science

tools for tabular data analysis in local and cloud settings. This will be achieved by conducting a

comparative analysis of local deployment versus cloud-based approaches, specifically utilizing

Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Performance Evaluation will assess the following criteria: scalability, efficiency, cost, computational

speed, data security & privacy.

 

## Dataset: 
Existing tabular data – applicable for GCP’s pre-trained Vertex API models as per:

## Methodological approach: 
Conduct an analysis, involving ML practices on a local machine, and

asses the performance. Next, transfer this infrastructure onto GCP directly, with limited usage of

Google’s services designed specifically for analysis/ML tasks, and asses performance. Keep

expanding the infrastructure (and assessing performance), introducing containerisation, and

replacing project elements with GCP services designed for such a task until complete migration to

GCP proprietary analysis/ML service(s).

 

## Resources required: 
Standard software packages available free to LJMU students + GCP

access.
